Install:
You have two files to change:
- first is config.py you must to replate __PATH__ by the path of your projects location for example D:/Projects
- second is the shelf, replace __PATH__ by the location of your scripts for example D:/PipelineTolls_Maya

Please be sure to use / and not \ when you past your path, it's very important.
The File opener can sometimes doesn't want to open, it's because in your project folder you have a file, it's very important to have only folders in thi path.

All the scripts are not from me in the shelf: the Divide UV, the Renamer,the Shader Library and the NameSpace Manager was made by others
You can find their name in the source code.

Now you can load the shelf in Maya.
